            <p>
              We're super excited that you're interested in participating in
              InnovatHER! Now, there will be prizes, but the focus of this event
              is to celebrate YOUR accomplishments‚Äîno matter how big or how
              small! We are confident that anyone can pursue careers in STEAM
              and challenge conventional gender standards.

            <h2>ü§î Wait... but why?</h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes, all the big accomplishments are celebrated so much that
              the little ones are overlooked. Since it's Women's History month,
              we need to recognize the current women who are contributing to
              history, starting with all of you. Even if it's the start of your
              STEAM journey, Girl Genius and Command Tech want to recognize the
              steps you are taking to build your dream projects with InnovatHER.
