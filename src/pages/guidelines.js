Now, there will be prizes, but the focus of this event is to celebrate YOUR accomplishments‚Äîno matter how big or how small!

            <Text>
                Sometimes, all the big accomplishments are celebrated so much that the little ones are overlooked. Since it's Women's History month, we need to recognize the current women who are contributing to history, starting with all of you. Even if it's the start of your STEAM journey, Girl Genius and Command Tech want to recognize the steps you are taking to build your dream projects with InnovatHER.
